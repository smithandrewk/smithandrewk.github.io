        I'm a machine learning engineer and musician based in South Carolina—two worlds that seem unrelated until you realize they're both about patterns, timing, and listening closely.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        By day, I work on AI at the University of South Carolina, wrapping up a PhD focused on time series analysis and smartwatch signal processing. Basically: I study the data your wearable collects and try to make sense of what it's telling us about health. It's the kind of work where academic rigor meets real-world impact, and I'm drawn to that intersection.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        By night (and many weekends), I'm behind a Nord or Moog, playing keys at church services, weddings, bars—wherever music takes me. I've been gigging seriously for years now, and it's become as central to who I am as the research. There's something grounding about showing up, reading a room, and making something together in real time that no amount of model tuning can replicate.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Outside of work and music, I'm usually on the stairmaster, tracking my Apple Watch metrics with the same curiosity I bring to my research. I renovated my house mostly by figuring things out as I went. I invest consistently and think a lot about building a life with margin—financial, physical, emotional.

        This site is a place to share what I'm working on, what I'm thinking about, and the moments worth remembering. If you're here, welcome. Let's make a cup of coffee.
